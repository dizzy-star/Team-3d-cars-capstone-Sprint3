3 Client Meetings were held over the course of this sprint. 
They occured on March 16th, 23rd, and 30th. In Prof. Li's office, DH 321 at 10:00 am. 

For the first Sprint, we pivoted our priority from a SUDO to Unity transfer to directly importing to Unity. 
  For this, he wanted us to get familiar with Unity, it's controls and functions, and be able to generate road structures using the Unity UI. 
  Additionally we should study what the data format of SUMO looks like and utilize knowledge of Unity to bridge the gap. 
 
For the second sprint, we demonstrated success, and that Unity was rendering roads and building structures from data extracted from OpenStreetMap. 
  For the next Goal, Li asked us to work on the roads, to fix up intersections and turns so that roads are not colliding and overlapping eachother. 
  Additionally, he asked to begin formulating a report of our work for this project, such that it could act as a kind of tutorial for someone that wished to know how 
  and what we did for this project. 
  
For the third Sprint, TBA
